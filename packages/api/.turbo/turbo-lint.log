Oops! Something went wrong! :(

ESLint: 9.33.0

A configuration object specifies rule "react/button-has-type", but could not find plugin "react".

Common causes of this problem include:

1. The "react" plugin is not defined in your configuration file.
2. The "react" plugin is not defined within the same configuration object in which the "react/button-has-type" rule is applied.
